## Project Introduction

2024 has been a difficult year for entry-level data science jobs and for this project, I am interested in analyzing the data science field job market. For this project, I am utilizing a Kaggle-based dataset that web-scraped Canadian job postings for data using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. This dataset provides multiple interesting insights into the data science job market such as in-demand technical skills, expected work experience, and salary ranges. The objective of this analysis is to train multiple machine learning models from scikit-learn to find the optimal model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Credit Card Fraud Machine Learning Model Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

| Columns | Description |
| :------------- | :------------ |
| Time | The number of seconds between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset |
| V1 | may be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features (v1-v28) |
| V... | may be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features (v1-v28) |
| V28 | may be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features (v1-v28) |
| Amount | Transaction amount |
| Class | 1 is for fraudulent transactions and 0 is for non-fraudulent transactions |



## Analysis Outline

- Allocated data into a testing, validation, and testing dataset at a 3-1-1 ratio

- The machine learning models used are the decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression models and all are from scikit-learn

- Trained, validated, and tuned hyperparameters for various machine-learning models to get the optimal accuracy score for each model

- Utilized the optimal machine learning model parameters and input the testing dataset to find the most accurate score for each machine learning model

- Utilize the optimal machine learning model parameters and input the testing dataset to find the highest accuracy score for each machine learning model

- Discovered the optimal machine learning model for the dataset

- Performed a sanity check to compare to the previous optimal model


## Conclusion

In conclusion, the random forest model is the optimal model to use to detect credit card fraud transactions based on the dataset provided. The random forest model recorded a 0.999365 accuracy score much higher than the minimum expected 0.8 accuracy score threshold. This value is significant because, in every 1 million transactions, the model will identify fraud correctly 999365 of the time.
